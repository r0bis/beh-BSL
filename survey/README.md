## Survey structure

This is survey structure file for the BSL-23 questionnaire. It does not contain any answers. 

* It can be imported to an existing limesurvey installation.

You just need to note the newly imported survey code, put it in the `.properties` file and you can use the reporting system straight away. This way you do not need to create the survey from scratch. Not that we would have expected you to, really.
