Here are some materials that are of use when implementing the project. Currently there are only two copies of the BSL Questionnaire. Both are PDF files that you can download and use as you  see fit.

* Borderline-Symptom-List-BLS-23.pdf - is a simple, print form of BSL-23
* BSL-all-questions-quexmlpdf.pdf - is an export the same questions from [LimeSurvey](https://limesurvey.org) (open source software that is used as questionnaire backend). This larger printout file can be used by software that automatically reads scanned questionnaire pages and converts them to data - i.e. avoids the need to give the completed paper questionnaire to an admin person who would then transcribe the answers - thus saving time and reducing potential errors. Scanner [QUEFX](https://quexf.acspri.org.au/) is open source as well, but probably an overkill for most needs.

> The fastest and most precise way to enter data is to provide a scannable code to the patient and record their answers in the data file immediately.
